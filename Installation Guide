## Installation Guide

To run the script, you'll need to install several tools. Follow the steps below to install each tool on a Linux system.

### 1. Install Go (if not already installed)
Most of these tools are written in Go, so you'll need it installed on your system.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y golang
```

Add Go binaries to your PATH if you haven't done so:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

2. Install Subfinder
Subfinder is a subdomain discovery tool.

```
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
```

3. Install Assetfinder
Assetfinder is another tool for finding subdomains.
```
go install github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder@latest
```

4. Install Amass (optional)
Amass is a powerful tool for in-depth subdomain enumeration.
```
sudo apt install -y amass
```

5. Install Httprobe
Httprobe helps you find live hosts among your discovered subdomains.
```
go install github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest
```

6. Install Waybackurls
Waybackurls fetches URLs from the Wayback Machine.
```
go install github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls@latest
```

7. Install Getallurls (GAU)
GAU fetches URLs from multiple sources.
```
go install github.com/lc/gau/v2/cmd/gau@latest
```

8. Install Anew
Anew ensures only unique lines are appended to your files.
```
go install github.com/tomnomnom/anew@latest
```

9. Install Grep
Grep is a standard tool for searching text using patterns. It's usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions.
```
sudo apt install -y grep
```

Final Setup
After installing all the tools, ensure your environment variables are set correctly:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

You can add the above line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make it permanent:
```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verification
You can verify the installation by running the following commands:
```
bash
Copy code
subfinder -version
assetfinder -version
amass -version
httprobe -version
waybackurls -h
gau -h
anew -h
```

If these commands return the version or help output, the tools are installed correctly, and you're ready to run the script.
